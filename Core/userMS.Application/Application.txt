Application layer surrounds the Domain Layer and together
they form the Core Layer of the application. Application Layer
acts as an intermediary between Domain Layer and the outermost
Infrastructure Layer and server as a bridge that enables the
interaction between domain logic and external world, where we
will be building our Presentation Layer to keep in touch with
the external world which will consist of UIs and APIs.

Application Layer defines:
- Repository and Service implementations (IRepository, IService, etc.)
- Data Transfer Objects
- Mappings
- Validators

In summary, the Application Layer is responsible for defining and implementing the 
use cases or application services that coordinate the domain logic with external 
systems and user interactions. It acts as a bridge between the Core Layer and the Infrastructure Layer, 
providing a clean and organized way to manage application-specific business logic and workflows.
