Domain Layer in Onion Architecture is where the application's core domain logic resides
It defines:
- Entitites
- Value Objects
- Domain Services
(Also some implementations include "Exceptions" about entities)

In summary Domain Layer is where application's core domain logic resides.
By keeping core domain logic of the application decoupled and independent,
developers can build more maintainable, testable and domain-focused code.
