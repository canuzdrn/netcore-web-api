Infrastructure Layer is the layer we implement our non-database related 
services and make them concrete. In some implementations, one might observe 
that both Infrastructure and Persistence Layer are built together yet in 
most of the implementations we see that Persistence Layer consist of the 
service implementations which are database related where infrastructure 
layer consist of service implementations that are related to business operations.

In order to make the idea more concrete we can give some examples of these business
operations:
- Email sending
- Notifications
- SMS sending
- Payment
