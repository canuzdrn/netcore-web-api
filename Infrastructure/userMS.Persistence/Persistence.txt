Persistence Layer is the outermost layer responsible for dealing with data storage and accessing external services. 
One can observe that in some of the implementations of the onion architecture, persistence layer may be implemented
together with infrastructure layer, however we will be implementing persistence layer as a different section where
we implement our concrete services/repositories in order to access the data of the application.
Hence, this layer contains concrete implementations of the interfaces defined in the Core and Application Layers and
its primary role is to provide a bridge between the domain logic in the Core Layer and the data storage or external services.

Persistence Layer defines:
- Repositories
- Data Mappers
- Data context
- External Services such as 3rd party APIs
- Database and Data Logic
